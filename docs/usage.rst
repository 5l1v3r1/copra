Introduction
------------

The CoPrA API provides two classes for creating a WebSocket client for the Coinbase Pro platform. The first, ``copra.websocket.Channel`` is intended to be used "as is." The second, ``copra.websocket.Client``, is the actual client class. It provides multiple callback methods to manage every stage of the client's life cycle.
